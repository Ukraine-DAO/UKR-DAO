## There are two different ways you can donate
+ A. Donations can be made by sending cryptocurrency directly to UkraineDAO.eth 
+ B. Donations can be made by participating in the 1x1 party bid

### Reasons to choose A: 
If you would like to make a donation available immediately for disbursement via UkraineDAO, then this is a good option if you do not have an on chain wallet set up already (i.e. you would like to send directly from an exchange like Coinbase). 
We understand some of you are new to setting up a crypto wallet and have very busy lives, but would like to donate.

### Reasons to choose B:
If you want to partake in the social aspect and would like to receive a LOVE token. These tokens have NO utility nor value, but are a beautiful testament and reminder of your contribution to a noble cause. 
note: You WILL need an on-chain wallet to participate in option B.
